# Contributing

- Run `make lint` before committing.
- Keep variables minimal and documented.
- Avoid provider blocks inside modules (define in examples).
- Use opinionated security by default (encryption on, public access off).
- Add an example in `examples/<cloud>-<usecase>/` for every new module.
